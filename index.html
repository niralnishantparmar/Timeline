      <div class="timeline-item" data-title="Battle of Monmouth" data-content="The Battle of Monmouth happened on June 28, 1778, in New Jersey. American troops, led by George Washington, attacked the British army as they were leaving Philadelphia. At first, the attack was messy, but Washington stepped in and got things under control. Even though the battle didn’t have a clear winner, it proved that the American soldiers had become stronger and more organized.">

      <div class="timeline-item" data-title="Battle of Vincennes" data-content="The Battle of Vincennes took place in February 1779 in Indiana. George Rogers Clark and his men marched through tough winter weather to surprise the British at Fort Sackville. They surrounded the fort and used smart tactics to make the British surrender. This win helped the Americans take control of the western frontier and made it harder for the British to hold power in that area.">

      <div class="timeline-item" data-title="John Paul Jones Defeats Serapis" data-content="During the naval Battle of Flamborough Head, John Paul Jones fought on his ship Bonhomme Richard against the Serapis and the smaller Countess of Scarborough of Britain. After taking a lot of damage to his ship, Jones was asked if he was ready to surrender when he famously declared, 'I have not yet begun to fight.' He then lashed their ships together to stay afloat and Jones and his crew were able to defeat the British from a close range, capturing the Serapis and boosting American morale.">

The soldiers faced one of the harshest winters of the Revolutionary War, with many perilous issues including deep snow, freezing temperatures, food shortages, and more.
