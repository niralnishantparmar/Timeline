      <div class="timeline-item" data-title="Battle of Monmouth" data-content="The Battle of Monmouth happened on June 28, 1778, in New Jersey. American troops, led by George Washington, attacked the British army as they were leaving Philadelphia. At first, the attack was messy, but Washington stepped in and got things under control. Even though the battle didnâ€™t have a clear winner, it proved that the American soldiers had become stronger and more organized.">

George Rogers Clark and his men marched through tough winter weather to surprise the British at Fort Sackville. They surrounded the fort and used smart tactics to make the British surrender.
