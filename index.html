      <div class="timeline-item" data-title="Battle of Monmouth" data-content="On June 28, 1778, the Battle of Monmouth was fought in New Jersey between the Continental Army, led by General George Washington, and British forces commanded by General Sir Henry Clinton. The British were retreating from Philadelphia to New York, and Washington saw an opportunity to strike their rear guard. The battle took place during a brutal heat wave, causing many soldiers to collapse from exhaustion. Early in the fight, American General Charles Lee hesitated and gave confusing orders, leading to disorganization. Washington stepped in, rallied the troops, and stabilized the front lines. Although the battle ended without a clear victory for either side, it proved that the Continental Army had become more disciplined and capable after training at Valley Forge. Washington’s leadership was praised, and the battle helped restore confidence in the American military’s ability to challenge British regulars in open combat." data-image="https://images.fineartamerica.com/images/artworkimages/medium/2/war-of-independence-of-the-united-states-of-america-1775-1783-general-george-washington-reproved-general-charles-lee-at-the-battle-of-monmouth-1778-colour-engraving-of-the-19th-century-american-school.jpg">

      <div class="timeline-item" data-title="Battle of Vincennes" data-content="During February of 1779, George Rogers Clark began his campaign to take control of British-held forts in the western frontier by capturing the town of Kaskaskia, located in present-day Illinois. This marked the start of a bold effort to weaken British influence in the Northwest Territory. Clark’s small force of frontiersmen surprised the town’s defenders, who surrendered without a fight. Clark then worked to gain the trust of French settlers and Native American tribes, convincing many to support the American cause. His success at Kaskaskia laid the groundwork for the later capture of Fort Sackville at Vincennes in February 1779. These victories expanded American control beyond the original thirteen colonies and helped secure claims to western lands that would be recognized in the Treaty of Paris. Clark’s campaign showed that the war was not just being fought on the eastern coast, but also in the vast interior of North America." data-image="https://www.battlefields.org/sites/default/files/styles/social_media/public/thumbnails/image/Hamilton%20Surrenders%20to%20Clark%20at%20Vincennes.jpg.webp?itok=0keQLkhl">

      <div class="timeline-item" data-title="John Paul Jones Defeats Serapis" data-content="During the Battle of Flamborough Head, patriot naval captain John Paul Jones fought on his ship Bonhomme Richard against the Serapis and the smaller Countess of Scarborough of Britain. After Jones took a lot of damage to his ship, the captain of the Serapis, Richard Pearson, asked him if he was ready to surrender when Jones famously declared, 'I have not yet begun to fight.' The battle lasted about 3-4 more hours, and Jones had to lash their ships together to stay afloat after many cannons made contact and wrecked the Bonhomme Richard. Jones and his crew were able to defeat the British from a close range in hand-to-hand combat, especially because the Bonhomme Richard was taller than the Serapis, so they could simply shoot of the soldiers below them. Eventually, after a final grenade was thrown onto the Serapis's deck, the battle ended and Jones capturing the Serapis, giving it to the French Navy as a prize ship and boosting American morale." data-image="https://www.battlefields.org/sites/default/files/styles/wys/public/The_action_between_the_Serapis%2C_capt._Pearson%2C_the_Countess_of_Scarborough%2C_and_Paul_Jones%E2%80%99s_Squadron._R.Paton_-_K325.jpg.webp?itok=FLQLynpZ">

      <div class="timeline-item" data-title="Winter at Morristown" data-content="In November 1779, George Washington’s main army began setting up camp at Morristown, New Jersey, for the winter. The soldiers faced one of the harshest winters of the Revolutionary War, with many perilous issues including deep snow, freezing temperatures, food shortages, and more. Despite these incredibly difficult conditions, Washington worked hard to keep his troops together and maintain their morale. The experience at Morristown tested the army’s endurance and unity, proving their determination to continue the fight for independence, and their perseverance through these hard times made it easier for them." data-image="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/-4FWeKPW3j13ixDhhCsusCihTGR7bf8bAp7n4fUlFnd1LPtuwdv-JzNjL7auF5xHcgmA3Z_m0eBLfWXeFmLbVx3d866b4asjYcSPr15YQlwlOQaktmk76qVi56e5uw">
